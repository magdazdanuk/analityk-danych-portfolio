## Overview
This project analyzes the sales data of a fictional coffee shop from 2019 to 2022. The main goal is to identify key trends related to:
-Revenue
-Product sales performance
-Profitability across different regions

The interactive dashboard was created using Microsoft Excel and includes:
Pivot tables
Slicers (filters)
Dynamic charts

This tool is designed to help business management quickly gain insights into historical sales data.



##Key Insights

-Sales increased by 8% from 2019 to 2020 but then dropped by 41% between 2020 and 2022
-The United States accounts for 78% of total sales
-The coffee market is balanced by type: Arabica, Excelsa, and Liberica each hold about 26–28% market share, while Robusta has a smaller share
-Average selling price is 22 PLN
-Revenues from sales with loyalty cards are nearly identical to those without
-Friday has the highest number of transactions, accounting for 18% of total sales
-Highest revenue is generated in June (11%), lowest in August (5%)



##Recommendations

-Conduct a thorough analysis to understand the causes of the sales decline
-Launch customer reactivation campaigns
-Consider targeted promotions during low-sales months, such as August
-Diversify geographic presence to reduce risk — explore emerging markets or countries with lower sales
-Develop localized marketing strategies for regions outside the US to increase market share
-Continue offering a diverse range of coffee types — customers engage with various bean types
-Review the loyalty program and consider adding exclusive benefits, points, or personalized offers
-Introduce Friday-focused promotions to further boost sales
-Plan new product launches in June, when customer interest peaks
